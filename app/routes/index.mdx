    <OverviewItem title="Hono" iconType="hono">
      [Hono](https://hono.dev) is a web application framework that supports any
      JavaScript runtime, including Cloudflare, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify,
      Node.js, and more. The RegExpRouter makes it super fast by avoiding any
      linear loops.
      Additionally, it is lightweight (14kB) and uses only the Web Standard API,
      meaning there are no dependencies. Developers can use built-in middleware
      or create their own to extend the framework.
