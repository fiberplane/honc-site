Most of the talk about the "best stack" in the TypeScript/JavaScript world is about "server components", "partial hydrations" and mayyyybe SPAs (if you're like from 2016).

But what if you need a simple backend to offload some work from your main application, power your 3rd-party integrations, run a background job, serve as an interaction layer for ✨AI✨? In other words: something to receive some JSON, store it, process it, and return it.

To create a data API you will need:
A database (duh)
An ORM layer
A router/middleware framework to help you wire it all together
Someone else's computer to deploy it all on
Probably 10,000 other libraries for validation, processing etc. but the above 4 will get you started.

<br />

  HONC is a loosey-goosey collection of technology choices, shoehorned into an acronym that would justify plastering an image of pixelated waterfowl all over the internet.

      <OverviewItem title="Hono" iconType="hono">
        [Hono](https://hono.dev). So hot right now. Hono is a Typescript framework for apis (and more!) that looks a lot like Express, except it’s smaller <i>(14kB smoll)</i>, lighter, faster, and runs anywhere that supports Web Standards. We’re talking Cloudflare, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, Node, and more. It has a bunch of helpful middleware to get you going, and a friendly and helpful community.

      <OverviewItem title="ORM (Drizzle)" iconType="orm">
         Someone on the Internet once said: <i>“In Typescript you want type safety between your database and your application.</i> Wise words. Do you need a traditional ORM for this? No, you do not. But we really wanted to put an O in HONC. And [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) ORM (our tool of choice)has a typesafe query builder for tons of relational databases.
         In the end: you either use an ORM or end up building one yourself.

      <OverviewItem title="Neon" iconType="db">
        Postgres is eating the world, one feature at a time! Need vector storage for your AI apps? Check. Need to stash some JSON blobs? Done. And for everything else, there’s an extension. [Neon](https://neon.tech) is a serverless Postgres database that branches like a pro and scales right along with your app. We also like Supabase, which throws in real-time updates, authentication and an edge runtime for good measure. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of databases—minus the corkscrew.

      <OverviewItem title="Cloud (Cloudflare)" iconType="cloud">
        We need a place to run our app, and unless you're nostalgic for the good ol' days of server-hugging (or enjoy the soothing hum of a dust-collecting machine in your basement), the cloud is where it's at. [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com)  loves Hono as much as we do, and it’s got your back for Python and Rust applications too.
