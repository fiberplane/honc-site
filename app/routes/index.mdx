<Intro>
  <p>
    Most of the talk about the "best stack" in the TypeScript world is about
    "server components", "partial hydrations" and maybe SPAs. What if you need
    a simple backend to run a background job, or power your third-party
    integrations (âœ¨AIâœ¨)? In other words: something to receive some JSON,
    store it, process it, and return it. To create a data API you will need:

    <ul>
      <li>ðŸª¿ A database (duh)</li>
      <li>ðŸª¿ An ORM layer</li>
      <li>ðŸª¿ A router/middleware framework to help you wire it all together</li>
      <li>ðŸª¿ Someone else's computer to deploy it all on</li>
    </ul>

  <OverviewItem title="Hono" iconType="hono">
    [Hono](https://hono.dev). So hot right now. Hono is a Typescript framework
    for apis (and more!) that looks a lot like Express, except itâ€™s smaller{" "}
    <i>(14kB smoll)</i>, lighter, faster, and runs anywhere that supports Web
    Standards. Weâ€™re talking Cloudflare, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, Node, and
    more. It has a bunch of helpful middleware to get you going, and a friendly
    and helpful community.
  </OverviewItem>
  <OverviewItem title="ORM (Drizzle)" iconType="orm">
    You either use an ORM or you live long enough to build one yourself.
    Typescript apis need some sort of contract between the data and the
    application code. Do you need a traditional ORM for this? No, you do not.
    But we really wanted to put an O in HONC. And
    [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) ORM (our tool of choice) has a typesafe
    query builder for tons of relational databases.

  <OverviewItem title="Neon" iconType="db">
    Postgres is bopping these days. Need vector storage for your AI apps? Check.
    Need to stash some JSON blobs? Done. And for everything else, thereâ€™s an
    extension. [Neon](https://neon.tech) is a serverless Postgres database that
    grows right along with your app, no AWS certification needed. We also like
    Supabase, which throws in real-time updates, authentication and an edge
    runtime for good measure. Just use Postgres.
  </OverviewItem>
  <OverviewItem title="Cloud (Cloudflare)" iconType="cloud">
    We need a place to run our app, and unless you're nostalgic for the soothing
    hum of a box in your basement, the cloud is where it's at. [Cloudflare
    Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) loves Hono as much as we do.
