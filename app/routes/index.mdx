  Welcome to the HONC stack, the new kid on the block that's making waves in the web development world. It's like the cool cousin of the MEAN stack who went backpacking through Europe and came back with a taste for artisanal code and craft databases. HONC stands for Hono, ORM (we're partial to Drizzle), Neon (or any other hip Postgres-based database), and Cloudflare (because who doesn't love a good cloud these days?).
<br />
  Buckle up, buttercup – we're about to take a wild ride through the land of lightning-fast routing, headless ORMs, databases that do everything but your laundry, and clouds that are more than just rain machines.

      <OverviewItem title="Hono" iconType="hono">
        [Hono](https://hono.dev) is your fast and furious api framework, supporting every JavaScript runtime you can dream of—Cloudflare, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, Node.js, and more. It’s lean and mean at just 14kB, with no dependencies, and powered by the Web Standard API.
      </OverviewItem>

      <OverviewItem title="ORM (Drizzle)" iconType="orm">
        [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) is a headless Object Relational Mapper (ORM). It maps the data logic presented in the database with the one in the application code. It’s like a matchmaker for your data. Drizzle offers both a relational and an SQL-like query API. And hey, we’re also big fans of Prisma, another fantastic ORM that brings its own flair to the table with real-time subscriptions and blazingly fast performance.

      <OverviewItem title="Neon" iconType="db">
        Postgres is eating the world, one feature at a time! Need vector storage for your AI apps? Check. Need to stash some JSON blobs? Done. And for everything else, there’s an extension. [Neon](https://neon.tech) is a serverless Postgres database that branches like a pro and scales right along with your app. We also like Supabase, which throws in real-time updates, authentication and an edge runtime for good measure. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of databases—minus the corkscrew.
      </OverviewItem>

      <OverviewItem title="Cloud (Cloudflare)" iconType="cloud">
        We need a place to run our app, and unless you're nostalgic for the good ol' days of server-hugging (or enjoy the soothing hum of a dust-collecting machine in your basement), the cloud is where it's at. [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com)  loves Hono as much as we do, and it’s got your back for Python and Rust applications too.
