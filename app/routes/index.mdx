    Today defining a stack for a new project is not easy, because there are a
    lot of different tools to choose from. With <abbr>HONC</abbr> we present an
    opinionated stack for Typescript development. <abbr>HONC</abbr> combines
    four components: H(ono), O(RM Drizzle), N(eon), C(loudflare). The stack
    helps to kick off projects quickly and ensures fast development cycles.

      <OverviewItem title="Hono" iconType="hono">
        [Hono](https://hono.dev) is a web application framework that supports
        any JavaScript runtime, including Cloudflare, Deno, Bun, Vercel,
        Netlify, Node.js, and more. The RegExpRouter makes it super fast by
        avoiding any linear loops. Additionally, it is lightweight (14kB) and
        uses only the Web Standard API, meaning there are no dependencies.
        Developers can use built-in middleware or create their own to extend the
        framework.

      <OverviewItem title="ORM (Drizzle)" iconType="orm">
        [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) is a headless Object Relational
        Mapper (ORM). It maps the data logic presented in the database with the
        one in the application code. Drizzle offers both a relational and an
        SQL-like query API.

      <OverviewItem title="Neon" iconType="db">
        [Neon](https://neon.tech) provides a serverless PostgreSQL database that
        supports branching. It is an open-source alternative to AWS Aurora and
        Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL. You can run Neon on-premises or use
        their managed service in the cloud. Neon separates compute and storage,
        allowing it to offer features like auto-scaling and branching.
