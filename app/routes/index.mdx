      Hono is a web application framework that supports any JavaScript runtime,
      including Cloudflare, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, Node.js, and more. The
      RegExpRouter makes it super fast by avoiding any linear loops.
      Additionally, it is lightweight (14kB) and uses only the Web Standard API,
      meaning there are no dependencies. Developers can use built-in middleware
      or create their own to extend the framework.
