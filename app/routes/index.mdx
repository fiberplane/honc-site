    Today defining a stack for a new project is not easy, because there are a
    lot of different tools to choose from. With HONC we present an opinionated
    stack for Typescript development. HONC combines four components: H(ono),
    O(RM Drizzle), N(eon), C(loudflare). The stack helps to kick off projects
    quickly and ensures fast development cycles.

    <OverviewItem title="Hono" iconType="hono">
      [Hono](https://hono.dev) is a web application framework that supports any
      JavaScript runtime, including Cloudflare, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify,
      Node.js, and more. The RegExpRouter makes it super fast by avoiding any
      linear loops.
      Additionally, it is lightweight (14kB) and uses only the Web Standard API,
      meaning there are no dependencies. Developers can use built-in middleware
      or create their own to extend the framework.

      query API.
