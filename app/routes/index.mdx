    intro={
      <p>
        Most of the talk about the "best stack" in the TypeScript world is about
        "server components", "partial hydrations" and maybe SPAs.
        What if you need a simple backend to run a background job, or power your
        third-party integrations (✨AI✨)? In other words: something to receive
        some JSON, store it, process it, and return it.
        
        To create a data API you will need:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>🪿 A database (duh)</li>
          <li>🪿 An ORM layer</li>
          <li>🪿 A router/middleware framework to help you wire it all together</li>
          <li>🪿 Someone else's computer to deploy it all on</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <OverviewItem title="Hono" iconType="hono">
        [Hono](https://hono.dev). So hot right now. Hono is a Typescript
        framework for apis (and more!) that looks a lot like Express, except
        it’s smaller <i>(14kB smoll)</i>, lighter, faster, and runs anywhere
        that supports Web Standards. We’re talking Cloudflare, Deno, Bun,
        Vercel, Netlify, Node, and more. It has a bunch of helpful middleware to
        get you going, and a friendly and helpful community.
      </OverviewItem>

      <OverviewItem title="ORM (Drizzle)" iconType="orm">
        You either use an ORM or you live long enough to build one yourself.
        Typescript apis need some sort of contract between the data and the
        application code. Do you need a traditional ORM for this? No, you do
        not. But we really wanted to put an O in HONC. And
        [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) ORM (our tool of choice) has a
        typesafe query builder for tons of relational databases.

      <OverviewItem title="Neon" iconType="db">
       Postgres is bopping these days. Need vector storage for your AI apps?
       Check. Need to stash some JSON blobs? Done. And for everything else,
       there’s an extension. [Neon](https://neon.tech) is a serverless Postgres
       database that grows right along with your app, no AWS certification
       needed. We also like Supabase, which throws in real-time updates,
       authentication and an edge runtime for good measure. Just use Postgres.
      </OverviewItem>

      <OverviewItem title="Cloud (Cloudflare)" iconType="cloud">
        We need a place to run our app, and unless you're nostalgic for the
        soothing hum of a box in your basement, the cloud is where it's at.
        [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com)  loves Hono as much
        as we do.
