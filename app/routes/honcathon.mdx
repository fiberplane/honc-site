    - Webhook Integration: as an example.: create a Goose Chat Bot, that
      leverages Telegram's Webhook API. Here is a [list with other awesome
      webhook APIs](https://github.com/realadeel/awesome-webhooks) to look into.

    - Cloudflare Workers AI: as an example: Create AI images of Geese and
      store them in Cloudflare R2 (their version of Amazon S3). Other AI cases
      are also welcome

    - Retrieval Augmented Goose : use Neon’s vector search capabilities to
      create a semantic search app or chatbot for a knowledgebase
